# Multiplayer Game

**Multiplayer Game** is a real-time, browser-based 3D game built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [Cannon-es](https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es), and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/). This project demonstrates how to create an interactive multiplayer environment where players can connect, interact, and compete within a dynamic 3D world.

## Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Connect multiple players in real-time using Socket.io, enabling seamless interactions and gameplay across the globe.
- **3D Graphics**: Powered by Three.js, the game features smooth 3D rendering with support for complex geometries, lighting, and textures.
- **Physics Engine**: Integrates Cannon-es to simulate realistic physics, allowing for dynamic interactions and collisions between objects.
- **Interactive Environment**: Players can move, jump, and interact with various objects in the game world.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Play directly in your browser with no need for downloads or installations.

## Base Source Code

This project is based on the source code from swift502/[Sketchbook](https://github.com/swift502/Sketchbook) v0.4. The base code provided a solid foundation for building the mechanics and 3D environment.
